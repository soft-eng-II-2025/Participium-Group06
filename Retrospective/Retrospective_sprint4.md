# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 06)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 6/6 
- Total points committed vs done : 35/35
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 96/100.5

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |

| Story 12     |   10  |  13  |  24     |   24.5       |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation) : Estimated avg : 2.23 / Real average : 2.37 | Estimated stdev : 2.69 / Real stdev : 2.70
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1 : 0.046

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 7
  - Total hours spent : 7.5
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 282
  - Coverage (if available) : 86%
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 4
  - Total hours spent : 4.5
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 2 
  - Total hours spent : 2
  - Coverage (integration + e2e) : 86% with 216 tests
- Code review:
  - Total hours estimated : 10
  - Total hours spent : 9.67
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted : A for secturity, B for maintainability and reliability. Included in code review.
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning : 1.5 (for configuration only)
  - Total hours spent : 4.5

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We don't have major issues with the estimation

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We learned that if we stay toghether as a team we can work through any difficulties
  - With practice we got better at estimating tasks.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

  - On the previous sprint we set a goal that was about adding more documentation and we can say that we achieved this goal, but it could be better.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - We didn't manage to comment the code for better debbuging because in order to stay within the estimation we undersrtood that there was not enough time to add the comments.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - We should try to do the planning as soon as the retrospective is over
  - The reviewers should be a little bit more available so the new changes don't take too much time to be accepted


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Despite the difficulties we faced, we managed to have the work done.
