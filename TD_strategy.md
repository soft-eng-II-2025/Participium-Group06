🎯 Main Priority

Scalability and modularity — these objectives were already part of Sprints 1 and 2, and remain top priorities.

📊 Targeted SonarCloud Criteria

Security: A (we want the highest security level)

Maintainability: A/B

Reliability: A/B

No High or Medium severity issues must be present.

🛠️ Planned Actions to Meet These Criteria

Existing code:
New tasks will be added in Sprint 3 to upgrade the legacy code to meet SonarCloud requirements.

New code (Sprints 3 and 4):
The reviewer must ensure that no new SonarCloud issues are introduced by the PRs.
This specifically requires special attention to the build.yaml pipeline configuration.
